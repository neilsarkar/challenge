# Collaborative Whiteboard Code Challenge

Create a shared whiteboard that allows people to collaborate with each other remotely in realtime. This is an open-ended challenge with endless solutions.

## Minimum requirements

* you must be able to draw a line with a mouse drag or finger drag.
* you must get realtime updates: if another person draws on the board, you should see what they're doing without a refresh.
* you must be able to use it from a mobile device.

## Technology

Use whatever you want, we love to see node.js or Go on the server, and a native app is always a plus...either via Swift/Objective-C or Java or HTML and cordova. If you're using html, we recommend using Canvas or SVG.

## Creative Spin

We're looking for developers who have a good product sense. Add something you think is missing from this whiteboard experience. Bonus points for originality, but execution is paramount.

## Submitting

Once you're happy with your solution, fork this repository, add your code, and submit a pull request with your solution. Answer these in your pull request:

* how long did you spend on this?
* what did you add beyond the minimum requirements? why did you think the product needed it?
* would you use your whiteboard with friends? why or why not?
* what would you add if you had more time?
* what would you clean up/refactor if you had more time?

Have fun!
